				<h3>Why?</h3>
				<p>It's easy to lose track of time when working on projects.  Entering approximate times into 
				timesheets was become an administrative headache for me; especially when working on multiple projects in a day.</p>  
				<p>This little app lets me just copy and paste the exact project time into my timesheets.</p>
