Project Clock application.

This is a small web app to run a clock for use with project timesheets.  Users are able to enter username, client
cost code and project code.  The app will time the work then output the result so it can be copied / pasted
into a timesheet.

It's a quick hack to solve an annoying problem with my timesheets!

Note: You'll need to create your own php file called "dbconnection.php" that contains the PDO connection details
for your database.
